       "'\\nHarshavardhana Gourineni:Thank you, Chairman. Dear Shareholders, it gives me immense pleasure to address you after a \\ngreat FY24 and a strong start to FY25. We have made significant progress in the Lead Acid \\nBattery (LAB) space in the areas of energy efficiency, carbon footprint reduction, and waste \\nminimization. In the last financial year, we recorded a surge in the LAB sector, a performance \\nthat mirrors the growth of the automotive and industrial market s in India. We have clocked \\nstrong numbers during FY24, with our operational revenue growing by 8.4% year -on-year and \\nour Profit Before Tax by 15.4%. Through digital implementations and creative process \\ninterventions, we were able to scale up our productio n capabilities to meet ever -growing \\ndemands, while our efforts towards building a more sustainable organisation have made our  \\nbatteries cleaner and greener. \\nAt Amara Raja, we are not only catering to this demand, but are also leading the charge with \\ninnovative solutions, such as material -efficient batteries with enhanced cycle life. On the \\nindustrial front, we are the market leader in Valve-regulated Lead Acid batteries for the telecom \\nindustry. Additionally, we were the first to introduce these VRLA batteries in India and operate \\nthe largest integrated facility manufacturing UPS and data centre batteries. In recent years, data \\nconsumption in India has grown exponentially along with rise of cloud -based services and \\nescalating demand for uninterrupted power, propelling the need for our best-in-class solutions. Our pioneering efforts also extend to the Indian Railways, where we have developed innovative \\nbattery solutions that ensure seamless operations. \\nThis past year in the automotive space, we developed cutti ng-edge products that have set new \\nperformance benchmarks. We have introduced AGM batteries for the automotive application, \\nwhich are ideal for the growing electrical loads and cranking requirements of vehicles, especially \\nstart-stop and hybrid vehicle app lications. These products have qualified with leading OEMs, \\nand we look forward to start supplies in the coming months. Additionally, we’ve extended our \\nDuraframe plate making technology to all our product ranges, bringing further reliability to these \\nproducts. On the international front, we have secured a foothold in the North American market, \\nstrengthening our global presence and catering to over 50 countries. We have received and \\nfulfilled breakthrough orders for 2 of the largest retailers in t he US, showing that our products \\ncan compete in the largest and most challenging markets. \\nI’m happy to share that the Amaron brand is the number one automotive battery brand not only \\nin the Indian aftermarket, but also in Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, and the UAE. This shows \\nthat we have been able to deliver our brand promise to diverse and dynamic market needs. We \\naim to be present in 80 countries in the coming years, while growing deeper market shares. Two \\nyears ago, we set ambitious sustainability targe ts for ourselves and have adopted sustainable \\nbusiness practices across all of our operations. We aspire to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 \\nas mentioned by our Chairman and have implemented a comprehensive strategy with targets \\naligned with the decarbonization approach as defined by the Science Based Target Initiative. We \\nhave been able to reduce energy intensity by 19% and carbon footprint intensity by 38%. As of \\nnow, nearly 24% of our total energy consumption is renewable with the installed capacity of 62 \\nMWh. \\nBesides reducing our own carbon footprint, our impressive 83% sourcing rate of recycled lead \\nand alloys reflects our commitment to fostering a circular economy. Installation of Zero Liquid \\nDischarge systems has resulted in a 20% reduction in absolute water usage and close to 95% of \\nour total manufacturing waste is recycled. I am glad to share that we are on the verge of \\ncommencing production at our battery recycling plant in Cheyyar, Tamil Nadu with an eventual \\ncapacity of 150,000 MTPA of lead. This facilit y will encourage responsible lead management \\nand minimize the environmental impact of our industry, while  also bringing increased security \\nto our supply chain. \\nThere are a few other notable programs that are driving our sustainability awareness and \\nperformance. The launch of the Amara Raja Sustainability Academy, an online training program, \\nis designed to equip our workforce with the requisite knowledge and skills for driving \\nresponsible progress. Our Sustainability Committee, composed of senior leadership,  regularly \\nreviews our sustainability performance to ascertain steady progress towards our goals and \\nprovide course corrections. Additionally, we conduct life cycle assessments for our products to \\nbetter understand and mitigate their ecological footprint. \\nAlso, on the social front, with ongoing community development initiatives, we have continued \\nto positively impact numerous lives. Our underground sewage project and the establishment of a second skill development centre are nearing completion. These projec ts are expected to \\nbecome operational in this year, creating a lasting impact on the communities we serve. Our \\nfocus on market segmentation, sustainability, technology development and customer service will \\nhelp ensure that we continue to play a crucial role in the dynamic energy and mobility sectors. \\nAs we progress through this financial year, the positive macroeconomic outlook paints a \\npromising picture for continued growth. Amara Raja is firmly positioned as the frontrunner in \\nthis flourishing industry, and we will continue to leverage technology and broaden our product \\nportfolio to capture emerging opportunities and contribute to a sustainable future. \\nI look forward to your sustained cooperation as we continue to travel onwards and upwards.  \\nThank you very much. Over to you, Vikram. '"

       " Document(metadata={'speaker_name': ' Jayadev Galla'}, page_content=' Dear Shareholders, The last fiscal year was marked by unprecedented global challenges; however, we have weathered the storm, emerged stronger, and become more resilient. The company’s journey reflects India’s growth story of transformation and remarkable progress. Through strategic diversification and bold new ventures, the last fiscal year was a landmark moment as we rebranded to ‘Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Limited’. This change goes beyond just a new name and symbolizes our broader vision and dedication. Our new identity reflects our ambition to lead India’s energy transition and signifies our evolution into a comprehensive solutions provider focused on innovation and sustainability in the energy and mobility sectors. Despite ongoing global g eopolitical tensions, the Indian economy has remained one of the fastest-growing in the world, and the country’s manufacturing sector has demonstrated strength and adaptability. Enhanced government impetus for promoting domestic manufacturing and other incentives has positioned our industry for growth. At Amara Raja, we envision that the expansion of the domestic manufacturing sector will have a positive and far -reaching impact on our business. Increasing awareness about clean energy, coupled with government incentives, has catalyzed the adoption of EVs in the country, resulting in a significant uptick in the demand for our EV batteries and chargers. As infrastructure and income levels rise, there is also a growing demand for vehicles, which has translated i nto heightened demand for powerful and reliable automotive batteries. Recognizing the potential of this growing market, we have been leveraging our strong capabilities in battery technology and our existing distribution network to cater to this demand. I am pleased to share that we have achieved healthy growth in our lead-acid battery business and have also ventured into new segments, such as lubricants. This diversification strategy has proven successful, opening up new revenue streams and enabling us to further bolster our market position. With a focus on expanding our global footprint, we are capitalizing on increasing demand for our products in international markets. Our robust product portfolio and reputation for delivering high -quality battery solution s have enabled us to forge strong partnerships and secure new business opportunities worldwide, including with two leading retail chains in the United States. Recognizing the market shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), we have prudently invested in research and development (R&D) and manufacturing of lithium -ion cells and batteries, as well as EV chargers. Another significant recent development has been our strategic agreement with global Li-ion tech leaders, paving the way for production at our upcoming Gigafactory. Our partners, Gotion InoBat for LFP technology and Jiangsu Highstar for NMC technology, will not only provide technology support but also manufacturing know -how and customized product development. Sustainability is a core principle at Amara Raja. During the fiscal year, we proudly affirmed our ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. We are also working towards shaping a better tomorrow for our communities. While research continues to show that a strong internal culture of integrity and inclusion fosters the best environment for innovation, we are maintaining a focus on both external and internal communities as we work to make a social impact and create a more equitable and innovative future. As we look ahead, our strategic focus remains on innovation, sustainable growth, and operational excellence. We will continue to invest in R&D, expanding our manufacturing capabilities, and strengthening our market position. Our commitment to delivering best -in-class products, fostering customer-centricity, and maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance will remain steadfast. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all our shareholders for their consistent support and trust in Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Limited. It is yo ur confidence and belief in our vision that have propelled us to new heights. Thank you for your continued support and investment. I will now call upon Harsha to talk a little about the different facets of the business from the year and Vikram can update o n the progress in the new energy vertical. Thank you! '),\n",

At Amara Raja, we are not only catering to this demand, but are also leading the charge with innovative solutions, such as material -efficient batteries with enhanced cycle life. On the industrial front, we are the market leader in Valve-regulated Lead Acid batteries for the telecom industry. Additionally, we were the first to introduce these VRLA batteries in India and operate the largest integrated facility manufacturing UPS and data centre batteries. In recent years, data consumption in India has grown exponentially along with rise of cloud -based services and escalating demand for uninterrupted power, propelling the need for our best-in-class solutions. Our pioneering efforts also extend to the Indian Railways, where we have developed innovative battery solutions that ensure seamless operations. This past year in the automotive space, we developed cutti ng-edge products that have set new performance benchmarks. We have introduced AGM batteries for the automotive application, which are ideal for the growing electrical loads and cranking requirements of vehicles, especially start-stop and hybrid vehicle app lications. These products have qualified with leading OEMs, and we look forward to start supplies in the coming months. Additionally, we’ve extended our Duraframe plate making technology to all our product ranges, bringing further reliability to these products. On the international front, we have secured a foothold in the North American market, strengthening our global presence and catering to over 50 countries. We have received and fulfilled breakthrough orders for 2 of the largest retailers in t he US, showing that our products can compete in the largest and most challenging markets. I’m happy to share that the Amaron brand is the number one automotive battery brand not only in the Indian aftermarket, but also in Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, and the UAE. This shows that we have been able to deliver our brand promise to diverse and dynamic market needs. We aim to be present in 80 countries in the coming years, while growing deeper market shares. Two years ago, we set ambitious sustainability targe ts for ourselves and have adopted sustainable business practices across all of our operations. We aspire to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as mentioned by our Chairman and have implemented a comprehensive strategy with targets aligned with the decarbonization approach as defined by the Science Based Target Initiative. We have been able to reduce energy intensity by 19% and carbon footprint intensity by 38%. As of now, nearly 24% of our total energy consumption is renewable with the installed capacity of 62 MWh. Besides reducing our own carbon footprint, our impressive 83% sourcing rate of recycled lead and alloys reflects our commitment to fostering a circular economy. Installation of Zero Liquid Discharge systems has resulted in a 20% reduction in absolute water usage and close to 95% of our total manufacturing waste is recycled. I am glad to share that we are on the verge of commencing production at our battery recycling plant in Cheyyar, Tamil Nadu with an eventual capacity of 150,000 MTPA of lead. This facilit y will encourage responsible lead management and minimize the environmental impact of our industry, while also bringing increased security to our supply chain. There are a few other notable programs that are driving our sustainability awareness and performance. The launch of the Amara Raja Sustainability Academy, an online training program, is designed to equip our workforce with the requisite knowledge and skills for driving responsible progress. Our Sustainability Committee, composed of senior leadership, regularly reviews our sustainability performance to ascertain steady progress towards our goals and provide course corrections. Additionally, we conduct life cycle assessments for our products to better understand and mitigate their ecological footprint. Also, on the social front, with ongoing community development initiatives, we have continued to positively impact numerous lives. Our underground sewage project and the establishment of a second skill development centre are nearing completion. These projec ts are expected to become operational in this year, creating a lasting impact on the communities we serve. Our focus on market segmentation, sustainability, technology development and customer service will help ensure that we continue to play a crucial role in the dynamic energy and mobility sectors. As we progress through this financial year, the positive macroeconomic outlook paints a promising picture for continued growth. Amara Raja is firmly positioned as the frontrunner in this flourishing industry, and we will continue to leverage technology and broaden our product portfolio to capture emerging opportunities and contribute to a sustainable future. I look forward to your sustained cooperation as we continue to travel onwards and upwards. Thank you very much. Over to you, Vikram. ')]"

So, I am glad to witness yet another year of all round growth and consistently growing year-on-year w e have witnessed rerating of our investment, of our stock price and which is very satisfactory as far as we shareholders are concerned. I have gone through the annual report and it speaks volumes. I am very happy that to listen to Harshavardhana, it reassures that our company will continue to grow quarter-on-quarter year-on-year from here on. And I am sure that where we are today as far as our investment is concerned, it will grow many times from here on in next few years itself. Now , we have 3 -4 small questions and I will request the board to kindly respond to it. And at the same time, I will also request that the shareholders such as me, who are asking these questions should remain unmuted so that in case we need any clarification, we may seek when the answers are given. So, my first question is pertaining to say, revenue and profitability. While there is a constant increase in say our revenue, topline and bottom-line year-on-year, but what I see is that the profitability there is some scope of some say, increase in this especially, say our operating margins and net operating margins. In fact, 2-3 years back, we used to have better operating margins than what we have witnessed in the year under review. So, my question is, what strategies are in place to improve the company's profitability in the coming years? How does the company plan to manage costs amidst fluctuating raw material prices ? My next question is with regard to, say, product competitiveness, so how does Amara Raja Energy and Mobility differentiate itself from the competitors in the energy storage and mobility sectors? What are the key challenges that the company is facing from competitors and how are these being addressed? My third question pertains to say, R&D, so in this case what I want to know , just allow me that how much is the company investing in research and development to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving energy and mobility sector? Can you provide us details on the recent innovations that the company has achieved particularly in EVs? And my last question pertains to the ESG and EPR. Recently, the MCA has issued guidelines pertaining to the extended producer responsibility and so if you can kindly throw some light on this, it will be very helpful for shareholder like me to understand where we are as far as this point is c oncerned? I appreciate the high level of corporate governance. I thank chief of our finance Babu ji and I acknowledge Chief of Secretary and Compliance, Vikas Sabharwal ji to maintain the high level of corporate governance. With this , I end my note and I look forward to your responses on the questions that I have raised. Thank you from my side, Namaskar. \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'speaker_name': ' Vikas Sabharwal'}, page_content=' Thanks, Delli. So, there were also some questions relating to dividend. So, we have declared interim dividend and paid Rs. 4.80 per share in November 2023 and the Board of Directors recommended final dividend of Rs. 5.10 paisa per share which amounts to total dividend for the year FY24 at Rs. 9.90 per share which is around 20% of the PAT, which is in line with the dividend distribution policy which is already there in the public domain as per the law in place. There was also question related to Investor Education Protection Fund. In compliance with the provision of the Companies Act 2013, the company has transferred the unclaim ed dividends as well as the share wherein the dividend has remaining unclaimed for a continuous period of 7 years year-on-year t o the IE PF. Company periodically issues notices and paper publications requesting the shareholders to claim their unclaimed dividends and shares from IEPF authority. Additionally, the company also issues notices and other communication requesting the shareholders to update their KYC and other bank account related documents with us as well as our RTA. All the information related to the process of claiming the shares from IEPF and KYC updation is also available on the website of the company. There were also a couple of questions with regard to the process of appointment of the Directors on the Board. As per the profile of those directors who are getting appointed are already part and parcel of the AGM notice. The said details are already in the notice, which is accompanied along with the annual report . The company is in compliance with all regulatory requirement with regard to appointment of the new Directors. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board selects the potential candidates and recommends such appointment to the board for their approval. The board approves the same and recommends such appointment to the shareholders for the final approval by the shareholders. And there was also a couple of questions with regard to issuance of bonus shares, so as of now, the Board is declaring dividend on a continuous basis, so there is no plan as of now as of today for issuance of any bonus shares since there is enough liquidity in terms of number of shares available with the public. The board will take up the decision at an appropriate time for any further corporate action, which includes all such things. Over to you, Jay. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'speaker_name': ' Srikanth Jhawar'}, page_content=' Respected Chairman and our Board of Directors, thank you. Please continue the meeting will be held in video conferencing. The first question is, sir, the day before yesterday, you have in BSE site that you have agreement with Ather. So, please give us some information about this agreement. And second question is now in two-wheeler, three-wheeler, which battery has got highest demand, please let us know about t his? And third question sir, now there is a demand for electric vehicles, then do you set up a service point or charging point in Andhra or all over India, so we have a lot of chances to get revenue from this. Please give us some information about that. And if you are a bonus candidate, then you think of issuing a bonus share in the future, then you will think that your equity is very small. Please give us some information about that. The way Q1 result has come, and we hope that our result will be better in Q2 if the result comes better then please give us interim dividend. It will be a great benefit to promoters as well as small investors hope for the dividend.

       " Document(metadata={'speaker_name': ' Praveen Kumar'}, page_content=' A very good afternoon to my respected Chairperson, well decorated team of Directors, my co- fellow shareholder, myself Praveen Kumar, joining this meeting from New Delhi. I have few observations which I love to share with the entire house. But before that, in this financial year, this is our fi rst interaction with the management. So, I wish entire management team each and every employee of our company a happy, healthy and prosperous future, sir. Coming down to my observation, it was the most excellent address by the management which is very informative for a retail investor like me. I am with the company for25 years, sir, and I see there are lots of up and down in the past , but the respective Chairperson, the leadership quality, the vision, the education you are having, which is unmatched in the industry. And last year it was very historical as far as all round growth is concerned. The future looks very bright because this is a very exciting space. I do remember clearly our respected PM, Narendra Modi sir, is very bullish on renewable energy and I am very thankful our company is pioneer in that aspect of it. So, we will be the biggest beneficiary in this. We have world class factory, world class R&D. Sir, if you see return in the last year, 600 to 1600, that is fantabulous as far as my investment i s concerned, excellent CSR activities by the management which truly reflect that the management who care for the community will grow leaps and bounds by the grace of God. My question to the management is, sir, AI is very much in flavor, and there are so many industries who are using it to cut down the cost and generate revenue. So, in the next 3 years, what will be the positive impact as far as the revenue is concerned, while using AI, just give me on percentage wise so I am very thankful to you? One more thing which I love to address here is I have deepest respect for our CS and his entirety because he has truly a multinational experience, he is going to be great asset for us as far as the communication is concerned with the retail investors. Tha t truly shows it is a red-carpet welcome from management side, truly shows that truly boosts our morale as far as investment is concerned. It is not about this event sir, which will be held once in a year, but during the course of time, if you have any upd ate of our company, they will be promptly replied. So, I am very thankful to our respected CFO , respected CS for their very proactive approach, the greatest communication with the retail investor.

       " Document(metadata={'speaker_name': ' Jayadev Galla'}, page_content=' Dear Shareholders, The last fiscal year was marked by unprecedented global challenges; however, we have weathered the storm, emerged stronger, and become more resilient. The company’s journey reflects India’s growth story of transformation and remarkable progress. Through strategic diversification and bold new ventures, the last fiscal year was a landmark moment as we rebranded to ‘Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Limited’. This change goes beyond just a new name and symbolizes our broader vision and dedication. Our new identity reflects our ambition to lead India’s energy transition and signifies our evolution into a comprehensive solutions provider focused on innovation and sustainability in the energy and mobility sectors. Despite ongoing global g eopolitical tensions, the Indian economy has remained one of the fastest-growing in the world, and the country’s manufacturing sector has demonstrated strength and adaptability. Enhanced government impetus for promoting domestic manufacturing and other incentives has positioned our industry for growth. At Amara Raja, we envision that the expansion of the domestic manufacturing sector will have a positive and far -reaching impact on our business. Increasing awareness about clean energy, coupled with government incentives, has catalyzed the adoption of EVs in the country, resulting in a significant uptick in the demand for our EV batteries and chargers. As infrastructure and income levels rise, there is also a growing demand for vehicles, which has translated i nto heightened demand for powerful and reliable automotive batteries. Recognizing the potential of this growing market, we have been leveraging our strong capabilities in battery technology and our existing distribution network to cater to this demand. I am pleased to share that we have achieved healthy growth in our lead-acid battery business and have also ventured into new segments, such as lubricants. This diversification strategy has proven successful, opening up new revenue streams and enabling us to further bolster our market position. With a focus on expanding our global footprint, we are capitalizing on increasing demand for our products in international markets. Our robust product portfolio and reputation for delivering high -quality battery solution s have enabled us to forge strong partnerships and secure new business opportunities worldwide, including with two leading retail chains in the United States. Recognizing the market shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), we have prudently invested in research and development (R&D) and manufacturing of lithium -ion cells and batteries, as well as EV chargers. Another significant recent development has been our strategic agreement with global Li-ion tech leaders, paving the way for production at our upcoming Gigafactory. Our partners, Gotion InoBat for LFP technology and Jiangsu Highstar for NMC technology, will not only provide technology support but also manufacturing know -how and customized product development. Sustainability is a core principle at Amara Raja. During the fiscal year, we proudly affirmed our ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. We are also working towards shaping a better tomorrow for our communities. While research continues to show that a strong internal culture of integrity and inclusion fosters the best environment for innovation, we are maintaining a focus on both external and internal communities as we work to make a social impact and create a more equitable and innovative future. As we look ahead, our strategic focus remains on innovation, sustainable growth, and operational excellence. We will continue to invest in R&D, expanding our manufacturing capabilities, and strengthening our market position. Our commitment to delivering best -in-class products, fostering customer-centricity, and maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance will remain steadfast. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all our shareholders for their consistent support and trust in Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Limited. It is yo ur confidence and belief in our vision that have propelled us to new heights. Thank you for your continued support and investment. I will now call upon Harsha to talk a little about the different facets of the business from the year and Vikram can update o n the progress in the new energy vertical. Thank you! ')]"
