Former India bowling coach Bharat Arun believes that if current Test vice-captain Rishabh Pant can adopt some of the traits of his idol MS Dhoni, he has the potential to become an excellent captain.

India are set to face England in a challenging five-match Test series starting 20 June. The series marks the beginning of a new era in Indian cricket, with Shubman Gill taking over as captain and Pant stepping in as his deputy.

While Pant has led in the IPL, he is yet to be part of the leadership group in the national team. As he embarks on this new role, Arun feels that Pant’s naturally composed demeanour could serve him well in a leadership capacity, drawing comparisons with the legendary Dhoni.

Dhoni is one of his biggest idols: Bharat
“His style (of captaincy) is different. But also, him staying behind the stumps, even in situations where the bowlers were taken for runs, he seemed pretty cool to me. I think, to Rishabh Pant, MS Dhoni is one of his biggest idols. And he spent a lot of time with MS. So, I think that experience and that calmness and the coolness which MS Dhoni is known for during matches, Rishabh Pant, even if he imbibes some of those qualities, he will go on to be a good skipper,” Bharat Arun told RevSportz.

England boast an impressive home record against India, having won the last three Test series on their soil. However, Pant’s own performances in England have been commendable, and he will be eager to set the tone as a leader as India look to secure their first Test series win in England since 2007.
